## Welcome!

I am an ecologist with over 10 years of experience in **marine mammal conservation**. My research focuses on spatial ecology and environmental changes, aiming to mitigate conflicts between biodiversity and human activities.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)](https://ufrj.br/en) and a courtesy postdoctoral associate at [Florida International University (FIU)](https://fiu.edu/).

I also collaborate with the [Marine Ecology and Conservation Lab (ECoMAR)](https://ecomarufrj.com.br/en/), the [Islands of Rio Project](https://ilhasdorio.org.br/), and the [Brazilian Humpback Whale Institute](https://www.baleiajubarte.org.br/).

### Interests

- Spatial modeling
- Human-wildlife interactions
- Conservation policy
- Open science
