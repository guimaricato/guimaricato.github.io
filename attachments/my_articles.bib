  abstract = {Marine ecosystems, especially coastal ones, are experiencing increased pressure from human activities. The first step to develop effective and appropriate management strategies is to understand the underlying processes of species distribution. The Guiana dolphin is a threatened coastal species, vulnerable to human-induced rapid environmental change due to its proximity to anthropogenic stressors. In this study, we modelled and mapped habitat suitability for Guiana dolphins in an anthropized estuarine complex: Sepetiba--Ilha Grande bays (SB-IGB), in the Brazilian southern coast, where multiple stressors have been affecting these populations. To predict habitat suitability, we ran 750 distribution models, including five algorithms (GLM, GAM, GBM, RF and MaxEnt), and generated an ensemble model with those that achieved ROC {$>$} 0.85. We categorized suitable areas (high, medium and low) by dividing equal intervals between maximum and cut-off values. Human activities were overlapped to qualitatively evaluate exposure to stressors. Our results demonstrated that 25\% of the SB-IGB complex is suitable for dolphins and they are more likely to occur in two unconnected shallow areas due to a deeper mid area. Of the suitable areas for dolphins, 90\% overlapped with anthropogenic stressors, such as industrial poles, ports, anchorage areas, dredged channels and shipping routes. This highlights the relatively strict habitat limits of this species in the SB-IGB estuarine complex, where the environment is rapidly changing. The proximity and overlap between areas that are highly suitable for dolphins and those where human activities take place underscore the need for effective conservation and regulation strategies, particularly as these areas support feeding and nursing.},

  abstract = {Studies show that the infection of cetaceans by socially transmitted diseases may impact the ecology and behavior of individuals and populations. Little is known about the effects of intense, short-term outbreaks of disease, typical of cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV). Understanding these effects is important in the case of resident populations exposed to multiple anthropogenic impacts, as in the case of the Guiana dolphins, Sotalia guianensis, of Sepetiba Bay (BSEP), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Two hundred and ten Guiana dolphins died of CeMV in BSEP between November 2017 and March 2018. We investigated whether the outbreak affected the occurrence of Guiana dolphins in the BSEP and whether the size, composition, and cohesion of the dolphin groups shifted significantly. We conducted 25 surveys in BSEP from 2017 to 2019 and found no significant variation between the two periods (pre-CeMV and post-CeMV) in either the occurrence of dolphins or the size, composition, or cohesion of groups. During the pre-CeMV period, 32 groups were observed, with a mean group size of 16.60\textpm 21.12 individuals, all groups containing at least one calf, while the ``tight'' group cohesion pattern was observed most frequently. Eighteen groups were sighted during the post-CeMV period, with a mean size of 23.67\textpm 27.51 individuals, with 87.50\% of groups containing at least one calf and ``mixed'' cohesion being the most frequent. We indicate that, over the short term, there was no significant change in the social dynamics of the Guiana dolphin groups in the BSEP after the morbillivirus outbreak, although further monitoring over a longer time scale, and focusing on specific aspects of the species would be necessary to provide more ample insights into the impacts of morbillivirus on this dolphin population. This is important in the context of the cumulative impacts of human activities on this population that have occurred over the past decade.},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance in natural environments poses an increasing threat to public health and biodiversity conservation. This study investigated antimicrobial resistance and biofilm formation in bacteria isolated from Inia araguaiaensis, an Amazonian endemic dolphin species. Skin lesion samples were collected from eight individuals in the Mocajuba region, Par\'a, Brazil. Bacterial isolation was performed on Brain Heart Infusion agar and Mannitol Salt agar. Species identification was carried out using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by disk diffusion following. Resistance genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction, and biofilm formation was assessed using the crystal violet staining method. A total of 19 bacterial isolates were recovered, including Staphylococcus spp. (n = 14) and Mammaliicoccus sciuri (n = 5). The most frequently identified species were Staphylococcus aureus (4/19; 21.1\%), S. warneri (4/19; 21.1\%), and S. epidermidis (4/19; 21.1\%). A high prevalence of penicillin resistance was observed (18/19; 94.7\%), followed by resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (each 4/19; 21.1\%), and gentamicin (3/19; 15.8\%). Four isolates (4/19; 21.1\%) exhibited a multidrug-resistant (MDR) profile. Genotypic screening revealed the presence of the blaZ gene in 8/19 isolates (44.4\%), followed by mecA, msrA, and norC (each 2/19; 10.5\%). The tetracycline resistance genes tetL and tetM were detected in 3/19 (15.8\%) and 1/19 (5.3\%) isolates, respectively. Biofilm formation was detected on 15/19 (78.9\%) of the isolates, of which 4/15 (26.7\%) were classified as strong producers, 1/15 (6.7\%) as moderate, and 10/15 (66.7\%) as weak producers. These findings support the recognition of river dolphins as potential sentinels for antimicrobial resistance in aquatic ecosystems and reinforce the importance of integrating microbiological monitoring into broader conservation efforts under the One Health perspective.},

We investigated the influence of environmental and anthropogenic variables on habitat use by humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and Bryde's whales Balaenoptera brydei off the coast of the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. Although there are 2 marine protected areas (MPAs) in this area, few data are available on cetacean habitat use or on the overlap of different cetacean species within these MPAs. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of the MPAs and propose a buffer zone to better protect the biodiversity of the study area. We conducted systematic surveys and developed spatial eigenvector generalized linear models to characterize habitat use by the species in the study area. Habitat use by humpback whales was influenced only by depth, whereas for Bryde's whales there was the additional influence of anthropogenic variables. For Bryde's whales, which use the area for feeding, sea surface temperature and the distance to anchorages had a major influence on habitat use. We also showed that neither of the MPAs in the study area adequately protects the hotspots of either whale species. Most of the humpback whale grid cells with high sighting predictions were located within 2 km of the MPAs, while areas of high sighting prediction of Bryde's whales were located up to 5 km from the MPAs, closer to beaches. Our findings provide important insights for the delimitation of protected areas and zoning of the MPAs.},

However, there is little information on the natural history and ecology of these delphinids. This study evaluated the occurrence, habitat use and individual movements of the species in coastal waters off Rio de Janeiro, south-eastern Brazil. Data were obtained from boat surveys between August 2011 and May 2018, during which rough-toothed dolphins were sighted in 21 distinct events, predominantly in autumn and winter. The mean group size was 29 individuals. Rough-toothed dolphins were usually recorded 130 to 2300 m from the coast, between 7.6 and 28 m depths. In total, 115 individuals were catalogued through dorsal fin marks and 61 (53\%) were resighted between one (47.5\%) and four (9.8\%) occasions. The interval between resightings ranged from seven to 2087 days (mean = 268). Agglomerative hierarchical clustering indicated 30 individuals (49.2\%) in low degree, 12 (19.7\%) in medium degree and 19 (31.1\%) in high degree of site fidelity. Dolphins showed a higher frequency of low degree of habitat use, despite the presence of multiyear recaptures, which may be related to the prevalence of dolphin occurrence in autumn and winter, a large home range and/or the abundance and distribution of food resources. Dedicated surveys and regional collaboration are needed to evaluate the home range and population status of this species for their effective conservation. Our findings enhanced knowledge of this little studied species facing increasing anthropogenic threats in coastal waters off Rio de Janeiro.},

This study highlights the effectiveness of collaborative research, through a network of volunteers who play an important role in obtaining data on the occurrence of cetaceans in coastal waters of the state of Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. The information was collected from data compiled through a group of the social network, Facebook, called ``Where are the Whales and Dolphins?'' between the years 2015 and 2019. A good analysis for Citizen Science programs should include a survey of demographic indicators on the characteristics of their volunteers. A greater adhesion of the group members was identified in January, a period of school recess in Brazil and in the summer, when there is increased coastal recreation and leisure activities. Membership in the social media group is mainly Brazilians (96.4\%), natives of the state of Rio de Janeiro (49.3\%), most often females (65.0\%) with a professional profile related to Environmental Sciences (34.9\%). From the information posted in the group, 315 sightings of eight species of cetaceans were recorded. The popularity of these animals, as a charismatic marine fauna, seems to facilitate the availability of the public to contribute to the acquisition and improvement of species' knowledge.

Impacts on coastal ecosystems may affect many key species, such as the Guiana dolphin, which inhabits Sepetiba Bay in south-eastern Brazil, a highly degraded environment owing to a human-induced rapid environmental change.                                                     In this context, this study investigates the potential changes in the local Guiana dolphin behaviour, group structure, bioacoustics, site fidelity and habitat use over the past 20~years.                                                     For this, a historical database (1998--2007) was compared with current data on the local dolphin population (2017--2019).                                                                          Between 2017 and 2019, the Guiana dolphins form significantly smaller groups (                     W                     ~=~3262.5,                     P                     ~{$>~$}0.001), spend more time foraging (61 vs. 10\% in the past), emit whistles at a considerably lower rate (decreasing by 85.2\%), have reduced site fidelity and now use a larger area.                                                                        As Sepetiba Bay has been severely impacted by human activities in the recent past, with profound consequences for much of its biodiversity, the observed changes in dolphin behaviour are probably a consequence of habitat degradation and, in particular, of reduced prey availability. These findings have important implications for the management and conservation of the Guiana dolphin population of Sepetiba Bay.                                                     To break this human-induced rapid environmental change, it will be essential to minimize the spatio-temporal overlap of anthropogenic impacts, to avoid cumulative impacts. To mitigate anthropogenic impacts on the Guiana dolphins of Sepetiba Bay, it will be important to direct the following actions: (i) the regulation and control of anthropogenic noise; (ii) reduction and control of the release of chemical contaminants and organic effluents; (iii) more effective controls on vessel traffic within the areas used preferentially by the Guiana dolphin; and (iv) the implementation of measures to avoid overfishing and bycatch.},

  abstract = {Seismic surveys introduce high levels of noise into the soundscape. Thus, a major concern is the effect of these noise levels on animal communication, especially for species with high hearing acuity, such as cetaceans. We evaluated the effects of airgun pulses of seismic surveys on the acoustic behavior of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) in the two most important basins for oil and gas off Brazil. We detect the presence of airgun pulses and measure sound pressure levels (SPL) to evaluate whether SPL changed the acoustic parameters of cetacean vocalizations. Airgun pulses increased the SPL by 17\%. This changes acoustic parameters differently: whales reduced call frequency and duration, while dolphins increased these parameters. In both cases, responses may be related to physiological limitations in sound modulation of each species. This was the first report on the impacts of seismic surveys on cetaceans' communications in Brazil and the first for the pantropical spotted dolphin on this topic in the world. Impacts vary with the frequency and duration of emissions, indicating species-specific acoustic responses that depend on airgun noise characteristics. Whales cannot make efficient adjustments at higher or lower frequencies, and dolphins cannot adjust at lower frequencies. These results are important for discussing the effects of airgun noise on cetacean communication.},

  abstract = {The risks from climate change are ever-growing, especially in more vulnerable and exposed regions such as coastlines. The rise in sea level and increase in the frequency and intensity of climate-induced coastal hazards are threatening the increasing coastal populations. Brazil, with its 8,500 km of coast, is one of the countries most at risk from coastal flooding and erosion. Nature-based solutions have been suggested as climate adaptation strategies with the greatest potential to counteract coastal hazards stemming from sea-level rise and safeguard coastal cities. However, there is still a knowledge gap in the scientific literature on the effectiveness of naturebased solutions, especially at large spatial scales in Central and South America. Here, we assessed the risks from climate-induced hazards of coastal erosion and flooding related to sea-level rise on the Brazilian coast, and the effectiveness of nature-based solutions as climate adaptation strategies. We reveal that nature-based shoreline protection can reduce by 2.5 times the risks to the Brazilian coastline. The loss of existing natural habitats would substantially increase the area and population at risk from these climate-induced hazards. Worrisomely, legal mechanisms to protect these natural habitats are few and being weakened. Only 10\% of the coastal natural habitats are within protected areas, and these alone do not ensure coastal protection, as our results indicate that the loss of unprotected natural habitats has about the same risk as the total absence of natural habitats. Our results warn of the severe consequences of the continued loss of natural habitats along the coast. Thus, actions towards the maintenance and protection of coastal habitats are paramount for climate adaptation and to ensure the well-being and livelihoods of coastal populations. Brazil has a central role in demonstrating the benefits of strategies based on nature-based solutions for shoreline protection, favoring their implementation worldwide. We provide both the natural habitat maps and the maps with model results with spatial and numerical information so readers can explore the relations between the natural habitats and coastal risk indexes at a subnational level and foster their use by local stakeholders.},

From July to October 2013, 113 groups, totaling 272 individuals (\=x = 2.41; \textpm{} 1.52), were observed, including possible double counts. Groups consisting of more than three individuals showed a significantly higher level of aerial behaviors and a more varied aerial behavioral repertoire compared to smaller groups. No significant differences in aerial behaviors were found in relation to month, the presence of calves in groups or depth. Studies about aerial behaviors can provide valuable information about sociality in humpback whales since their communication system is not limited to sound and can differ according to the environment.},

The common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, is well studied worldwide, but very little attention has been given to transient groups of this species and how such groups are exposed to human activities. Here, we modeled and mapped how the environment and human activities drives bottlenose dolphin habitat suitability, and residence patterns in an anthropized area of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. To predict habitat suitability, we ran 300 distribution models, including six algorithms, and generated an ensemble model. In parallel, we used photo-identification techniques to investigate dolphins' residence patterns. Our results demonstrated that primary productivity, seabed slope and port activities explained dolphins' habitat suitability. The most suitable areas included coastal waters, nearby port complexes and shipping routes. We also identified a low degree of residence in Cabo Frio and Rio de Janeiro city waters, but calves were constantly sighted there, indicating an important area for caring and nursing. The high overlap between the dolphins' most suitable areas and human activities, such as ports, vessel traffic and fisheries spots, plus the presence of calves in these areas, highlights the need for safeguard measurements to protect these animals from anthropogenic threats. Our results can be used to support management decisions, such as fisheries regulations and the creation of new marine protected areas to conserve critical habitats for this species.},

  abstract = {The giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus) is the largest armadillo species, inhabiting vast areas of South America, including forests, savannas, and grasslands. The Rio Doce State Park (RDSP) is an important conservation unit that harbors P. maximus individuals. The largest environmental disaster in Brazil occurred in 2015 when a dam collapse released tons of iron ore tailings into the Rio Doce basin. In addition to this tragedy, plastic pollution is a growing concern for the conservation of this area and raises an alert for microplastic pollution. In the present study, we investigated the presence of microplastics and heavy metals (Al, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn, Ti, and Zn) in the feces of the giant armadillo from Rio Doce State Park to understand the invisible threats to which this species is susceptible in two areas (North and South) of RDSP. All feces samples were positive for the tested heavy metals and microplastics. Cr, Mn, and Pb levels were significantly higher in the North area, while microplastics were more abundant in the South area. The most common microplastic types identified were polypropylene (PP, 32.5 \%), polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 22.5 \%), and polyethylene (PE, 15.0 \%). Several studies have reported the harmful effects of heavy metals and microplastics on mammals. The simultaneous presence of both contaminants highlights significant concerns for conserving this species and underscores the need for greater attention to the human impacts on RDSP's biota. This study represents an initial approach seeking to understand the exposure levels of a threatened mammal species to two relevant pollutants allowing it to offer support for new strategies for mammal conservation.},

Given this, the present study quantified the proportion of dolphins with different body condition scores and assessed temporal variation in these scores between 2017 and 2022 through the analysis of photographic records. We analyzed the photographs and identified the individuals using FinFindR and classified each individual based on its apparent body condition. A total of 29,737 photographs were taken during the study, and 79 individuals were identified, of which 68.35\% were in poor condition. The evidence suggests that the Guiana dolphins are in relatively poor condition overall, possibly reflecting the cumulative impact of human activities in Sepetiba Bay.},

There were fifteen sightings of different groups throughout the year. An overall of 429 individuals were photo-identified. 90.7\% dolphins did not present a degree of residence, 1.4\% dolphins were considered with high residency to the area, 5.8\% medium and 2.1\% low. Our habitat use map indicated dolphins were more common off \textasciitilde 10km from Cabo Frio municipality and between depths around 20-70m. Bottlenose dolphins on Cabo Frio coast were more frequently observed performing travelling, followed by foraging and socio-sexual behavior. Group sizes varied from three to 120 individuals. Larger groups were observed when travelling and foraging. Despite the existence of two local Marine Protected Areas, the fast human development in Cabo Frio may threaten this important area for bottlenose dolphins in terms of food resources and shelter from predators.},

  abstract = {Ocean warming, acidification, and deoxygenation are expected to intensify without significant climate mitigation. In the tropics, rising ocean temperatures may push marine species to their thermal limits, leading to redistributions and cascading effects on communities and ecosystems. We evaluate how future climate change scenarios could impact the habitat suitability of an endemic species of the western tropical Atlantic Ocean, the Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis. Using data from systematic surveys conducted between 1987 and 2023 complemented by open-source databases, we built the most comprehensive occurrence dataset for the species and developed ensemble Species Distribution Models to predict future distributions under the latest CMIP6 projected scenarios---`optimistic' (SSP1-2.6), `intermediate' (SSP2-4.5), `pessimistic' (SSP5-8.5)---using expert knowledge to validate model predictions in the present. Our models project substantial range contractions under all climate scenarios. By 2070, under the pessimistic scenario, suitable habitat is expected to decline by 46.9 \%, nearly doubling the habitat loss projected under the optimistic scenario (23 \%). Guiana dolphins are expected to lose habitat in northeastern Brazil and along the Caribbean coast (except Costa Rica). Remaining suitable areas are expected to become fragmented and confined to southeastern and southern Brazil, where the coastal zone is the most urbanized and degraded. Currently, only 21.6 \% of the predicted Guiana dolphin range overlaps with Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and just 1.8 \% is covered by MPAs that prohibit extractive activities---a small proportion expected to decline from 19 \% to 14 \% in the future. Our study highlights the urgent need to incorporate climate change into conservation strategies for coastal tropical marine predators.},
